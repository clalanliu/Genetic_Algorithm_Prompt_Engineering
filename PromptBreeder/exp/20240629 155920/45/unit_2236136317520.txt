Result: As I embarked on my 10-year journey to unravel the intricacies of love, I knew that it would require unwavering dedication and a willingness to confront the complexities head-on. I began by immersing myself in the works of renowned philosophers, poets, and scientists, seeking to understand the multifaceted nature of love. I devoured books, attended seminars, and engaged in lively debates with fellow enthusiasts, gradually building a comprehensive framework for understanding this enigmatic emotion. As I delved deeper, I realized that measuring progress or success in solving the problem of love was akin to attempting to quantify the essence of a sunset â€“ it defied precise evaluation. Yet, I knew that I had to find a way to assess my journey, lest I become mired in the quagmire of self-doubt. I turned to innovative metrics, such as the 'Love Quotient' (LQ), which combined elements of emotional intelligence, empathy, and self-awareness to provide a nuanced evaluation of my progress.
