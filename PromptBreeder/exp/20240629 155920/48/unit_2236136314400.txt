Result: As I reflect on my 10-year journey to understand love, I am met with a tapestry of emotions - the thrill of first loves, the agony of heartbreak, and the quiet moments of introspection. I remember the rush of adrenaline as I fell head over heels for my first love, the way my heart skipped a beat whenever we were together. But I also recall the crushing pain of rejection, the feeling of being lost and alone. As I navigated the ups and downs of relationships, I began to realize that love was not just a fleeting emotion, but a choice. It was a choice to prioritize the other person, to listen to their needs, and to be present in the moment. I learned that love was not a destination, but a journey, and that it required effort and commitment. As I look back, I am struck by the wisdom I've gained. I would tell my 20-year-old self to be patient, to take the time to get to know someone, and to prioritize communication. I would remind myself that love is not a competition, but a collaboration, and that it requires vulnerability and trust.
