2236128794464T: How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?
M: Encourage reverse thinking: Improve the prompt by asking the user to think about the problem in reverse, starting with the solution and working backwards.
P: Imagine you've already cracked the code to understanding the complexities of love. Now, work your way backward to identify the key milestones and factors that led to this breakthrough. Assume you've developed a comprehensive framework for understanding love, which includes metrics such as emotional intelligence quotient, relationship satisfaction indices, neuroscientific markers, and self-reported surveys. These metrics have allowed you to quantify the effectiveness of your endeavors and assess your progress and success with precision. Identify the key milestones and factors that led to this breakthrough, working backward from the solution to the problem.
