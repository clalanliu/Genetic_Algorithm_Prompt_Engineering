2236128777280T: What are the key assumptions underlying this problem?
M: Step into the realm of imagination and create a mutator prompt that transcends limitations and encourages innovative mutations. Break through the ordinary and think outside the box to generate a mutator prompt that unlocks new possibilities and unconventional paths.
P: Imagine a world where love is not just a sentiment, but a tangible force that can be harnessed and manipulated. Scientists have discovered a way to extract and quantify love from human hearts, allowing them to create a Love Index that measures the intensity and purity of emotions. As a result, a new industry has emerged, where Love Engineers design and build structures that amplify and focus love energy. Your task is to create a Love Engine that can generate a specific type of love, such as familial love, romantic love, or platonic love. Consider the following variables: * The emotional resonance of the Love Engine's design * The materials used to construct the engine, and how they affect the love energy * The environmental factors that influence the Love Engine's performance * The potential applications of the Love Engine, such as healing, conflict resolution, or social bonding. As you design and build your Love Engine, consider the following questions: * How can you optimize the Love Engine's design to maximize its emotional resonance? * What materials would you use to construct the engine, and why? * How would you test and calibrate the Love Engine to ensure its effectiveness? * What are the potential risks and challenges associated with harnessing and manipulating love energy? Your Love Engine should be a testament to the power of human creativity and innovation, as well as a reflection of the complexities and mysteries of the human heart.

Result: In a world where love was a tangible force, a team of Love Engineers designed a revolutionary new device that could generate familial love. The Nurture Love Engine, with its warm, golden-hued wood and soft, plush interior, was designed to resemble a cozy nest. The engine's core was a delicate pattern of copper and silver wires, infused with calming essential oils. As people sat within the engine's embrace, they felt a deep sense of comfort and security, as if they were wrapped in a warm hug. The Nurture Love Engine had the potential to heal emotional wounds, resolve conflicts, and bring people together. But as with any powerful technology, there were also risks and challenges associated with harnessing and manipulating love energy. The engineers knew that they had to be careful, lest their creation be used to manipulate or control others. Despite the challenges, the Nurture Love Engine was a testament to the power of human creativity and innovation, and a reflection of the complexities and mysteries of the human heart.
