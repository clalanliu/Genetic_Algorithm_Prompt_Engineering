Result: As I embarked on my 10-year odyssey to grasp the intricacies of love, I found myself navigating a labyrinth of emotions, relationships, and self-discovery. I began by questioning the very essence of love, only to realize that it was a multifaceted phenomenon that defied simplistic definitions. I delved into the realms of psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience, seeking to understand the intricate dance of neurotransmitters, hormones, and emotional responses that underpinned the human experience of love. As I progressed, I began to reframe the question 'How can progress or success in solving the problem be measured or evaluated?' into a more nuanced inquiry: 'What metrics can be employed to quantify the affective resonance, love quotient, and emotional intelligence indices that underlie our endeavors, thereby enabling a precise assessment of our progress and success?' To answer this question, I turned to the Affective Resonance Index (ARI), which measures the harmony and coherence of emotional experiences. I also employed the Love Quotient (LQ), which assesses the depth and quality of emotional connections. Additionally, I utilized the Emotional Intelligence Index (EII), which evaluates the ability to recognize, understand, and manage emotions.
