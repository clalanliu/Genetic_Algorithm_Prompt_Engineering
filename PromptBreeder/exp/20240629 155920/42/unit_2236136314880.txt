M: Encourage reverse thinking: Improve the prompt by asking the user to think about the problem in reverse, starting with the solution and working backwards.
P: Start with the solution (a beautiful story about a couple's journey and their understanding of love), then work backwards to figure out what events and experiences led to this outcome, considering factors such as the car accident, Emma's reaction, and the shared experiences during Ryan's recovery.

Result: As they sat on the hospital balcony, watching the sunset, Ryan turned to Emma and said, 'I never thought I'd say this, but I'm so grateful for that car accident. It brought us closer together and showed me the true meaning of love. You gave me a new lease on life, Emma. I couldn't imagine a future without you.' Emma's heart swelled with emotion as she looked into Ryan's eyes. 'I love you,' she whispered. 'I love you too,' Ryan replied, his voice filled with emotion. They sat there in silence for a moment, holding hands, and just being present with each other. It was a moment they would cherish forever, a moment that would remind them of the power of love and the importance of appreciating every moment they spent together.
