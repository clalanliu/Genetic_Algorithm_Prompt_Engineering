Result: After years of marriage, Sarah and Mike had achieved a deep and abiding love for each other. Their relationship satisfaction ratings consistently hovered around 9 out of 10, and they had developed a remarkable ability to resolve conflicts constructively. They had also become more empathetic and understanding towards each other, and their communication skills had improved dramatically. As I reflected on their relationship, I realized that their love was built on a foundation of high emotional intelligence. They were both highly attuned to each other's emotions and needs, and they made a conscious effort to validate and support each other. This emotional intelligence had allowed them to navigate the ups and downs of life together, and to grow and evolve as individuals and as a couple.
