Result: I spent 10 years studying love, pouring over research papers, conducting interviews, and observing human behavior. I discovered that love is not just a feeling, but a complex system that is deeply rooted in societal structures. I found that societal expectations, cultural norms, and economic inequalities all play a significant role in shaping our understanding of love. I saw how societal pressure to conform to traditional gender roles and beauty standards can lead to toxic relationships and emotional distress. I saw how economic inequality can create power imbalances in relationships, leading to exploitation and abuse. I saw how cultural norms around love and relationships can be oppressive, forcing individuals to conform to certain expectations. To improve the working out of the problem, I believe that we need to address these systemic issues. We need to challenge societal expectations and cultural norms that perpetuate harmful relationships. We need to work towards economic equality and provide resources and support for individuals to make their own choices about love and relationships. We need to create a society that values and respects all individuals, regardless of their gender, race, or socioeconomic status.
