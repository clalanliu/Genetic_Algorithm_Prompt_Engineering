Result: As I embarked on my 10-year odyssey to grasp the complexities of love, I found myself navigating a labyrinthine tapestry of emotions, desires, and vulnerabilities. I began by studying the ancient Greeks, who posited that love was a combination of eros, philia, and agape. I delved into the works of poets and philosophers, seeking to understand the intricacies of the human heart. As I progressed, I encountered the concept of 'liminal love,' a fleeting yet profound connection that transcends the boundaries of time and space. I discovered that love can be both a source of strength and a catalyst for growth, yet also a source of pain and vulnerability. To measure progress or success in solving the problem of love, I propose the concept of 'amorometric evaluation.' This innovative approach involves tracking the ebb and flow of emotions, the depth of connection, and the resilience of the relationship. By quantifying the qualitative aspects of love, we can better understand the dynamics of this complex and multifaceted emotion.
