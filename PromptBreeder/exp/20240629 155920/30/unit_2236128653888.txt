Result: I embarked on a 10-year journey to understand love, a quest that would take me through the depths of human emotion, the highs of euphoria, and the lows of heartbreak. It began with a naive notion that love was a feeling, a fleeting sensation that would wash over me like a warm summer breeze. But as I navigated the complexities of relationships, I realized that love was so much more. I learned to love through the eyes of others, watching as they poured their hearts and souls into their partners, their children, and their friends. I saw the way they sacrificed, compromised, and forgave, and I began to understand that love was not just a feeling, but a choice. A choice to prioritize the well-being of another, to put their needs before your own, and to stand by their side through life's triumphs and tribulations. As I continued on this journey, I faced my own share of heartbreak and disappointment. I learned to love myself, to forgive myself, and to let go of the need for validation from others. And in the end, I came to understand that love is not just a feeling, but a way of being. It's a choice to show up, to be present, and to love unconditionally, even when it's hard.
