Result: As I embarked on my 10-year odyssey to grasp the intricacies of love, I encountered a labyrinth of emotions, thoughts, and experiences. I traversed the realms of romantic love, familial love, platonic love, and self-love, unraveling the threads of attachment, intimacy, and vulnerability. With each step, I refined my understanding, yet the enigma of love remained tantalizingly elusive. To measure the progress or success in solving this problem, I propose the concept of 'Affective Resonance Quotient' (ARQ). ARQ assesses the harmony and depth of emotional connections, quantifying the resonance between individuals. This metric can be evaluated through surveys, interviews, and observational studies, providing a comprehensive assessment of our endeavors. To quantify the effectiveness of our endeavors, we can employ metrics such as Emotional Intelligence Quotient (EIQ), Attachment Style Index (ASI), and Empathy Index (EI). By employing these metrics, we can evaluate the progress and success of our journey, refining our understanding of love and its complexities.
