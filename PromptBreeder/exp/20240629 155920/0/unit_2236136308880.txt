Result: I spent 10 years of my life studying, observing, and experiencing love. I wanted to understand its intricacies, its complexities, and its mysteries. I read books, attended seminars, and even conducted my own experiments. And finally, after a decade of dedication, I thought I had cracked the code. But as I looked back on my journey, I realized that understanding love wasn't the end of the story. It was just the beginning. I had to think about the problem in reverse, starting with the understanding of love and working backwards to the beginning of the journey. So, I asked myself: what led me to understand love in the first place? Was it a specific event, a person, or a moment of clarity? And what about the people I met along the way? What did they teach me about love, and how did they shape my understanding of it? As I reflected on my journey, I realized that understanding love was just the tip of the iceberg. The real journey was the one that led me to that understanding, and the people and experiences that made it possible.
