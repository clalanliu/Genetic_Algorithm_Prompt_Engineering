Result: I was 20 when I first realized that I didn't truly understand love. I had experienced romantic relationships, but they always seemed to end in heartbreak. I felt like I was just going through the motions, never truly connecting with anyone. So, I made a decision to dedicate the next 10 years to understanding love. I started by reading books on psychology, philosophy, and spirituality. I devoured self-help books, attended workshops, and even took online courses. I learned about attachment styles, emotional intelligence, and the science of attraction. I practiced mindfulness, meditation, and journaling to better understand myself and my emotions. As I delved deeper into my research, I began to notice patterns and commonalities in my own relationships. I started to recognize the signs of toxic relationships and learned to set healthy boundaries. I also discovered the importance of self-love and self-acceptance. By the end of the 10 years, I had gained a profound understanding of love and was ready to apply it to my own life.
