Result: I began my journey to understand love when I was 20 years old. I thought love was a feeling, something that happened to me without my control. But as I navigated relationships and heartbreaks, I realized that love was more than just a feeling. It was a choice, a decision to prioritize someone else's happiness above my own. It was an action, a daily commitment to show up for the people I cared about. Over the next 10 years, I learned that love was a muscle that needed to be exercised. It required effort, patience, and understanding. I learned to communicate effectively, to listen actively, and to forgive freely. I learned that love wasn't a destination, but a journey. And I learned that the more I chose to love, the more I felt loved in return.
