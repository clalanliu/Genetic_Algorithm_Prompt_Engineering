Result: I spent 10 years studying love, pouring over books, attending seminars, and conducting experiments. I interviewed couples, analyzed their relationships, and even tried to replicate their experiences. I thought I had it all figured out, but the more I learned, the more elusive love became. I realized that love wasn't just a feeling, but a choice. It was a decision to prioritize someone else's happiness above your own. It was a willingness to listen, to compromise, and to grow together. But even with this newfound understanding, I struggled to apply it to my own life. I had relationships, but they always seemed to end in heartbreak. I felt like I was stuck in a cycle of love and loss. It wasn't until I met someone who loved me for who I was, flaws and all, that I finally understood the true meaning of love. It was a feeling of acceptance, of belonging, and of being seen.
