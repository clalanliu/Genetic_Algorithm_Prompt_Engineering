Result: I was 20 when I first realized that I didn't understand love. I had been in relationships, but they all ended in heartbreak. I felt like I was missing something fundamental. So, I made a decision to dedicate the next 10 years to understanding love. I read books, attended workshops, and even took a course on relationships. I met people from all walks of life, heard their stories, and learned from their experiences. As the years went by, I began to see patterns and common themes. I learned that love is not just a feeling, but a choice. It's a decision to prioritize someone else's happiness above your own. I learned that love requires vulnerability, trust, and communication. I learned that love is not a destination, but a journey. After 10 years, I felt like I had finally grasped the concept of love. I was no longer confused or uncertain. I had a newfound sense of confidence and clarity. I knew that I was ready to love and be loved in return.
