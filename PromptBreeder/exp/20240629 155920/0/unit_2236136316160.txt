Result: I was 20 when I first realized that I didn't truly understand love. I had experienced romantic relationships, but they always seemed to end in heartbreak. I felt like I was just going through the motions, without any real connection or understanding. So, I made a decision to dedicate the next 10 years to studying love. I read books, attended workshops, and even took a course on the psychology of love. I met people from all walks of life, hearing their stories and experiences. I learned about the different types of love, from romantic to platonic to self-love. I discovered that love is not just a feeling, but a choice. It's a choice to prioritize others, to be vulnerable, and to be patient. And slowly but surely, I began to understand love. I learned to love myself, and to love others for who they truly are. And by the end of those 10 years, I had finally found the love I had been searching for.
