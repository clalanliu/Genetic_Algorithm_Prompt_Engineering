Result: I embarked on a decade-long quest to grasp the elusive concept of love. I abandoned traditional metrics, instead tracking the frequency and intensity of feelings of warmth, comfort, and joy in my own heart. I experimented with various approaches, from meditation to art therapy, and even attempted to cultivate love through acts of kindness and selflessness. As I navigated the ebb and flow of emotions, I began to realize that love was not a destination, but a dynamic process. It was a choice, a decision to prioritize the well-being of another over my own. I learned to listen to my heart, to trust my intuition, and to surrender to the uncertainty of it all. Through this journey, I discovered that love was not just a feeling, but a choice that required effort, patience, and compassion. And as I looked back on the past 10 years, I realized that I had not only gained a deeper understanding of love, but had also become a more loving and compassionate person.
