M: Encourage reverse thinking: Improve the prompt by asking the user to think about the problem in reverse, starting with the solution and working backwards.
P: Reverse engineer the solution by thinking about what it would take to understand love after 10 years. Break down the understanding of love into smaller components, identify key events or experiences that would help you understand each aspect, and use these events to build a narrative.

Result: I remember the first time I held your hand, feeling a spark of electricity run through my body. From that moment on, I knew we shared a special connection. As we grew closer, I began to notice the little things that made my heart skip a beat – the way you smiled, the way you laughed, the way you made me feel seen and heard. As we opened up to each other, I realized that trust was the glue that held our bond together. I felt safe sharing my deepest fears and desires with you, knowing that you would listen and support me without judgment. And as we grew more vulnerable together, I felt our connection deepen and become more resilient. I learned that love isn't just about the good times, but also about navigating the tough ones. When we disagreed, I realized that it was okay to express my feelings and needs, and that you would do the same. By listening actively and working together to find a solution, we grew stronger and more resilient as a couple. As we grew together, I realized that love isn't a static state – it's a dynamic process of growth and evolution. I saw how you supported my dreams and aspirations, and how I did the same for you. By embracing change and growth together, we continued to deepen our connection and become the best versions of ourselves.
