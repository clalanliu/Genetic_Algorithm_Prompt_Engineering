Result: Lessons Learned: I've come to realize that love is not a feeling, but a choice. It's a decision to prioritize someone's happiness above your own. It's a willingness to listen, to compromise, and to grow together. The Turning Point: After 5 years of being in a relationship, I hit rock bottom. My partner and I were constantly arguing, and I felt like I was losing myself in the process. I realized that I had been taking my partner for granted and that I needed to make a change. The Journey Backwards: I started by taking a step back and re-evaluating my priorities. I realized that I had been focusing too much on my own needs and desires, and not enough on my partner's. I started making an effort to listen to them, to support them, and to be present in the moment. The Beginning: It all started 10 years ago, when I first fell in love. I was young and naive, and I thought that love was all about feelings and romance. But as I grew older and wiser, I came to realize that love is so much more than that.
