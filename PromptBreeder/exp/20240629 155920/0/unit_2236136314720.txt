Result: I spent 10 years studying love, pouring over books, attending workshops, and observing the relationships around me. I wanted to understand this mysterious force that could bring people together and tear them apart. I learned that love is a choice, a decision to show up and be present for another person. It's not just a feeling, but a commitment to grow and evolve together. I saw couples who had been together for decades, still holding hands and gazing into each other's eyes. I saw friends who had been through thick and thin, supporting each other through life's ups and downs. And I saw strangers who had never met, yet still felt a deep connection to one another. As I delved deeper, I realized that love is a journey, not a destination. It's a path that winds and turns, with moments of joy and moments of struggle. But it's the choice to keep showing up, to keep being present, that makes all the difference.
