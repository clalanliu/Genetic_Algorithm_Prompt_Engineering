Result: I was 20 when I first realized that I knew nothing about love. I had been in relationships, but they were all about me and my own desires. I didn't know how to truly care for someone else. So, I made a decision to dedicate the next 10 years to learning about love. I read books, attended workshops, and sought out mentors who could guide me. I practiced active listening, empathy, and compassion. I learned to put others' needs before my own and to communicate effectively. I also learned to forgive and let go of past hurts. As I grew, I began to attract people into my life who were also on a journey of self-discovery. Together, we explored the depths of love and learned to cherish each other. By the end of the 10 years, I had transformed into a person who truly understood the meaning of love.
