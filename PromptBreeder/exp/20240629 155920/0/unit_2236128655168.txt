Result: I was 20 when I first realized that I knew nothing about love. I had been in relationships, but they were all superficial and fleeting. I felt like I was just going through the motions, never truly connecting with anyone. So, I made a decision to dedicate the next 10 years of my life to learning about love. I read books, attended workshops, and even took a few courses on the subject. I studied the works of philosophers, poets, and psychologists. I learned about attachment styles, emotional intelligence, and the science of attraction. I practiced mindfulness, meditation, and self-reflection. I even took a few risks and put myself out there, trying new things and stepping out of my comfort zone. As the years went by, I began to notice changes in myself. I felt more confident, more compassionate, and more present in my relationships. I learned to communicate more effectively, to listen more deeply, and to love more fully. And when I finally met the person who would become my partner, I was ready. I was ready to love with all my heart, and to be loved in return.
