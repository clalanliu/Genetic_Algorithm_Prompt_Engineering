Result: I spent 10 years studying love, pouring over scientific research, philosophical texts, and personal anecdotes. I delved into the chemical reactions in the brain, the release of dopamine and oxytocin, and the way they can create a sense of euphoria. I explored the social construct of love, how it's shaped by culture, upbringing, and societal norms. I even examined the existential theories, where love is seen as a fundamental aspect of human existence. As I dug deeper, I began to see love as a complex tapestry, woven from threads of biology, psychology, and sociology. I realized that love is not just a feeling, but a choice, a commitment, and a willingness to grow and evolve alongside another person.
