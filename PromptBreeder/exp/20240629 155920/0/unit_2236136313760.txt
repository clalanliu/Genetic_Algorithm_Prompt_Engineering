Result: I spent 10 years studying love, delving into its complexities and nuances. I explored the ways in which systemic and structural issues can affect our experiences of love. I examined how societal norms, cultural expectations, and economic inequalities can shape our perceptions of what love should look like. I considered how power dynamics can influence relationships, and how marginalized communities often face unique challenges in expressing and receiving love. I looked at how technology has changed the way we interact with each other, and how social media can both bring people together and drive them apart. Through my research, I came to understand that love is not a fixed concept, but rather a dynamic and ever-changing force that is shaped by the world around us. I realized that love is not just a feeling, but a choice that requires effort, commitment, and empathy.
