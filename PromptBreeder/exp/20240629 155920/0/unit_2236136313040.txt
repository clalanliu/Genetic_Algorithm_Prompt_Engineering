Result: I spent 10 years studying love from various disciplines - neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. I delved into the intricacies of the brain, exploring the release of dopamine and oxytocin, the hormones responsible for the feelings of pleasure and attachment. I analyzed the psychological theories of attachment and the various stages of love, from infatuation to commitment. But it wasn't until I stumbled upon the concept of 'non-dualism' in philosophy that I began to grasp the true nature of love. Non-dualism posits that the distinctions between subject and object, self and other, are illusory. Love, I realized, is not a feeling between two separate entities, but a fundamental aspect of the universe, a web of interconnectedness that transcends individual boundaries. As I integrated this understanding into my being, I felt a profound shift within myself. I no longer saw love as a fleeting emotion, but as a fundamental reality that underlies all existence. And in this realization, I found true freedom and peace.
