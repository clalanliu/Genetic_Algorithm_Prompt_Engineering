Result: I spent 10 years studying love, pouring over theories, conducting experiments, and observing human behavior. I delved into the complexities of attachment, intimacy, and commitment. I discovered that love is not just a feeling, but a complex system that is shaped by societal norms, cultural expectations, and structural inequalities. I found that love is often tied to societal expectations of gender roles, beauty standards, and economic stability. Women are often expected to prioritize relationships and caregiving, while men are expected to be providers and protectors. This creates an imbalance in power dynamics, leading to feelings of resentment and frustration. To improve the working out of this problem, I propose a shift in societal norms that values emotional intelligence, communication, and mutual respect. We need to challenge traditional gender roles and promote a culture of equality and empathy. By doing so, we can create a more just and loving society where individuals can form meaningful connections without the burden of societal expectations.
