Result: I first experienced love at 18, when I fell for my high school sweetheart. It was a whirlwind romance, filled with butterflies and sweet nothings. But as we grew apart, I realized that love wasn't just a feeling, but a choice. Over the next few years, I made mistakes, like jumping into relationships without thinking them through. I learned that love requires communication, trust, and compromise. As I entered my mid-twenties, I began to understand the importance of self-love and self-acceptance. I learned to prioritize my own needs and desires, and to recognize that love is not a competition. I also learned to let go of toxic relationships and to surround myself with positive, supportive people. After a decade of learning, growing, and making mistakes, I've come to understand that love is a journey, not a destination. It's a choice to show up, to listen, and to be present for the people in your life. And most importantly, it's a choice to love yourself, flaws and all.
