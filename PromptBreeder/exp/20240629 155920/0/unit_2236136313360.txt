Result: As I delved deeper into the concept of love, I began to realize that it's not just a feeling, but a complex web of systemic and structural issues that shape our understanding of it. I saw how societal norms and expectations, often rooted in patriarchal and capitalist systems, dictate what love should look like and who deserves it. I noticed how marginalized communities, such as people of color, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals, are often excluded from the narrative of love, or forced to conform to heteronormative and cisnormative standards. I saw how economic and social pressures can lead to toxic relationships, and how the lack of resources and support can make it difficult for people to leave abusive situations. I realized that love is not just a feeling, but a choice, and that it requires effort, communication, and mutual respect. I saw that love is not just a personal experience, but a social and political issue that requires systemic change.
