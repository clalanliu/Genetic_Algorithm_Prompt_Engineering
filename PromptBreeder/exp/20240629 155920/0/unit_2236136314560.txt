Result: I embarked on a journey to understand love when I was 20. I had just gone through a painful breakup and was left wondering what love truly meant. Over the next decade, I read books, attended workshops, and had countless conversations with friends and strangers. I learned that love wasn't just a feeling, but a choice. It was a decision to prioritize others' happiness and well-being above my own. As I grew and learned, I began to recognize that love wasn't just romantic. It was the love I had for my family, my friends, and even myself. I learned to love myself, flaws and all, and to accept that I was worthy of love and respect. Through this journey, I discovered that love is a journey, not a destination. It's a constant process of growth, self-reflection, and self-improvement. I learned to be patient, kind, and compassionate towards myself and others. And I discovered that true love is not about finding someone else, but about becoming the best version of myself.
