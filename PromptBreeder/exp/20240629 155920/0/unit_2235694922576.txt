Result: I spent 10 years of my life studying love, trying to understand its intricacies and complexities. I read books, attended seminars, and even conducted my own experiments to grasp the concept. I met people from all walks of life, heard their stories, and learned from their experiences. I discovered that love is not just a feeling, but a choice. It's a decision to prioritize someone's happiness above your own. I saw how people loved unconditionally, without expecting anything in return. I saw how love could bring people together, and how it could also tear them apart. As I delved deeper, I realized that love is not just romantic love, but also familial love, platonic love, and self-love. I learned that love is a journey, not a destination. It's a process of growth, learning, and evolution. After 10 years of studying love, I finally understood its true meaning. Love is not just a feeling, but a choice to make someone's life better. It's a choice to be there for them, to support them, and to make them feel loved.
