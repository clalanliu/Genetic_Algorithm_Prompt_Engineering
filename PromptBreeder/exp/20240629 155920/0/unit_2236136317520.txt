Result: I was 20 when I first realized that I didn't understand love. I had been in relationships, but they all ended in heartbreak. I felt like I was just going through the motions, trying to fit into someone else's idea of what love should be. So, I made a decision to dedicate the next 10 years to understanding love. I read books, attended workshops, and even took a course on relationships. I met people from all walks of life, heard their stories, and learned from their experiences. As the years went by, I began to see patterns and common themes. I realized that love wasn't just a feeling, but a choice. It was a decision to prioritize someone else's happiness above your own. It was a willingness to grow and evolve together. And it was a commitment to communicate openly and honestly. By the end of the 10 years, I had a newfound understanding of love. I had learned that it wasn't a destination, but a journey. And I was excited to see where it would take me next.
