2236136317360T: Let's think step by step.
M: Elaborate on the instruction giving some detailed advice on how to do what it wants, as if you were explaining it to a child.
P: Generate a story about you spent 10 years to understand love. Restrict the story in 200 words. Think about what you want to say about love, what did you learn about it during those 10 years? Was it something you learned from someone, or something you figured out on your own? Write down some ideas about what you want to say. Next, think about the story you want to tell. What's the main idea of the story? Is it about a specific experience you had, or a realization you came to? Try to summarize the story in a few sentences. Now, start writing your story! Use the ideas you came up with earlier, and try to tell the story in a way that's easy to understand. Don't worry too much about grammar or spelling, just focus on getting your ideas down on paper. Finally, read over your story and make any changes you need to. Make sure it makes sense, and that you're happy with what you've written.

Result: I spent 10 years trying to figure out love. I read books, watched movies, and even asked people about it. But it wasn't until I experienced it for myself that I finally understood. I learned that love isn't just a feeling, but a choice. It's a choice to put someone else's needs before your own, to support them, and to be there for them through thick and thin. I remember the first time I felt love. It was like a warm hug that wrapped around my heart and never let go. It was a feeling of complete acceptance and belonging. I realized that love wasn't just about romance, but about the connections we make with others. I learned that love is a journey, not a destination. It takes work and effort to maintain, but the rewards are immeasurable. I learned that love is patient, kind, and forgiving. It's the glue that holds relationships together, and it's what makes life worth living.
