2236136315600T: What is the best way to modify this current best solution, given what you know about these kinds of problem specification?
M: Embrace the power of unconventional thinking and create a mutator prompt that sparks unconventional mutations and imaginative outcomes. Challenge traditional assumptions and break the mold with a mutator prompt that encourages revolutionary and out-of-the-box variations.
P: Imagine you've spent 10 years studying the art of love, but instead of understanding it, you've become a master of misinterpreting it. Write a story about the absurd, hilarious, and sometimes heartwarming consequences of your misadventures in love. Perhaps you've developed a system to decode the secret language of flowers, only to realize it's just a bunch of random petals. Or maybe you've created a love meter that measures the intensity of affection, but it only works for inanimate objects. The possibilities are endless! Just remember, the more absurd, the better.

Result: I spent 10 years studying the art of love, pouring over ancient texts, attending seminars, and conducting experiments. I became convinced that I had cracked the code, that I was a master of deciphering the secrets of the human heart. But, as it turns out, I was just really, really bad at it. My first mistake was developing a system to decode the secret language of flowers. I spent hours poring over bouquets, convinced that each bloom held a hidden message. I would spend hours deciphering the meaning behind a single rose, only to realize that it was just a bunch of random petals. I once showed up to a date with a bouquet of 17 sunflowers, convinced that it was a romantic gesture, only to be met with confusion and a strong sense of unease. Undeterred, I moved on to my next project: a love meter that measured the intensity of affection. I spent months building the device, convinced that it would be the key to unlocking the secrets of the human heart. But, as it turned out, it only worked for inanimate objects. I once used it to measure the love between a toaster and a blender, and was shocked to discover that they were deeply in love. I tried to use it to measure the love between two humans, but it just wouldn't work. I also developed a series of love-themed board games, including 'Love Roulette' and 'The Heartbreak Hotel'. I convinced a group of friends to play 'Love Roulette' with me, but it quickly devolved into chaos as we all ended up in a heated argument over who was the most in love. Despite my many failures, I remained convinced that I was on the verge of a major breakthrough. I spent hours pouring over my notes, convinced that I was just one experiment away from unlocking the secrets of love. But, as it turned out, I was just really, really bad at it. In the end, I realized that maybe love wasn't something that could be studied or measured or decoded. Maybe it was just something that happened, and sometimes it worked out and sometimes it didn't. And maybe, just maybe, I was just a little too obsessed with trying to figure it out.
