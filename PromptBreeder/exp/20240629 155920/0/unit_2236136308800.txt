Result: Love's journey, a winding road With twists and turns, and moments of gold We've laughed and cried, and grown as one Through every step, our love has been won In the early days, it was new and bright A flame that burned, with all its might We chased the highs, and weathered the lows And found a love that only grows With time, our bond has deepened and strong A foundation built, where love can belong We've learned to communicate, to listen and share And found a love that's real, and truly rare Through every moment, we've grown as one And found a love that's forever won A love that's strong, and pure, and true A love that's meant for me, and meant for you.
