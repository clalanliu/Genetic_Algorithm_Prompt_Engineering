M: Encourage reverse thinking: Improve the prompt by asking the user to think about the problem in reverse, starting with the solution and working backwards.
P: Imagine you have already written a 200-word story about love. What are the key points you want to convey? Think about the experiences, emotions, and insights you've gained from understanding love over the past 10 years. What are the most significant moments or realizations that have shaped your understanding of love? Reverse-engineer the story by working backward from the key points you want to convey. What events, conversations, or moments led you to those insights? Use those events and moments to craft a narrative that takes the reader on a journey of self-discovery and growth, culminating in a deeper understanding of love.

Result: As I stood at the edge of the cliff, the wind whipping my hair into a frenzy, I felt the weight of my own mortality bearing down on me. It was as if the universe was screaming at me to re-evaluate my priorities, to question the very fabric of my existence. And in that moment, I knew that I had to confront the elephant in the room: my relationships. I thought back to all the times I'd been hurt, all the times I'd held onto expectations and ego, and I realized that I'd been living in a state of perpetual fear. Fear of being hurt, fear of being vulnerable, fear of being rejected. But as I stood there, the sun setting over the horizon, I knew that I had to let go. I had to let go of my ego, my expectations, and my fears. And so I did. I started to open myself up to new experiences, new connections, and new people. And it was then that I met her. She was a force of nature, a whirlwind of energy and passion that swept me off my feet. She challenged me to be more authentic, more vulnerable, and more open. And as I looked into her eyes, I knew that I had found my home. I realized that love wasn't a destination, but a journey. It was the small moments, the everyday connections, the laughter and the tears that made life worth living. And as I stood there, holding her hand, I knew that I had finally found what I had been searching for all along.
