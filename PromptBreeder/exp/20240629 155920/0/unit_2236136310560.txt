Result: I spent 10 years studying love, and what I discovered was that it's not just a feeling, but a choice. It's a choice to prioritize the well-being of others, to put their needs before your own. I saw it in the way a community came together to support a single mother, in the way a group of strangers became a family after a natural disaster. I also saw that love is a transformative force. It can change the way we see the world, the way we treat each other, and even the way we see ourselves. I saw it in the way a person's entire perspective shifted after finding their soulmate, in the way a community's dynamics changed after a group of activists brought people together. But most importantly, I saw that love is a choice that requires effort and commitment. It's not a feeling that comes and goes, but a decision to show up for each other every day. And that's what I learned about love after 10 years of studying it.
