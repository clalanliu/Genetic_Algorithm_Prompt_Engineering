Result: As I embarked on a decade-long odyssey to unravel the enigmatic tapestry of love, I found myself entwined in a labyrinth of emotions, grappling with the ephemeral nature of human connection. Initially, I approached love as a rational endeavor, attempting to codify its intricacies into a set of empirical formulas.
