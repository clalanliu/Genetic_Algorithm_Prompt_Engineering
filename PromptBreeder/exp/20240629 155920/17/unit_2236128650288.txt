Result: As I reflect on my 10-year journey to understand love, I am met with a profound sense of clarity. I have come to realize that love is not a feeling, but a choice. It is a deliberate decision to prioritize the well-being and happiness of another being above one's own. This epiphany has been a long time coming, marked by a winding path of triumphs and failures, highs and lows. I remember the early days, when love was a fleeting sensation, a euphoric rush of emotions that left me breathless and bewildered. I chased after it, desperate to recapture the feeling, only to find myself lost in a sea of heartbreak and disappointment. But with each failure, I learned to temper my expectations, to recognize that love was not a destination, but a journey. As I navigated the complexities of relationships, I discovered the importance of communication, trust, and empathy. I learned to listen with intention, to validate the emotions of others, and to be present in the moment. And with each passing year, my understanding of love deepened, until I finally grasped the truth: that love is not a feeling, but a choice.
