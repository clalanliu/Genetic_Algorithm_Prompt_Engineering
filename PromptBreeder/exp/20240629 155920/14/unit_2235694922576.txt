Result: As I embarked on my 10-year odyssey to grasp the complexities of love, I encountered numerous twists and turns, each revealing a new facet of this enigmatic emotion. I delved into the realms of psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience, seeking to understand the intricate dance of emotions, desires, and attachment. Along the way, I discovered that love is a multifaceted phenomenon, defying simplistic definitions and quantification. To measure progress or success in solving the problem of love, I propose the following innovative metrics: Emotional Intelligence Quotient (EIQ), Relationship Resilience Index (RRI), and Love Literacy Score (LLS). To calibrate the resonance frequency of our endeavors, we must attune ourselves to the oscillations of love. This can be achieved by cultivating emotional awareness, empathy, and compassion. By harmonizing our efforts with the rhythms of love, we can amplify our progress and success.
