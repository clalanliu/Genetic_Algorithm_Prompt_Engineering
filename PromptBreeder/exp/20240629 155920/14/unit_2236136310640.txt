Result: I embarked on a 10-year odyssey to grasp the complexities of love, embracing unconventional ideas and innovative metrics to measure progress and success. Along the way, I developed the Heartbeat Harmonization Index (HHI), Emotional Resonance Quotient (ERQ), and Love Language Proficiency (LLP) to quantify the effectiveness of my endeavors. After refining my research and integrating the metrics, I created a comprehensive Love Index (LI) that combines HHI, ERQ, and LLP scores. I published my findings, presenting them at international conferences and workshops, and developed a mobile app, 'Love Insights,' which uses AI-powered algorithms to provide personalized love advice and relationship coaching. The app became a global phenomenon, helping millions of people improve their relationships and deepen their understanding of love.
