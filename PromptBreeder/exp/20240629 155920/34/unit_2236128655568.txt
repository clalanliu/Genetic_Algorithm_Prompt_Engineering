Result: As I embarked on my 10-year odyssey to grasp the intricacies of love, I encountered a labyrinth of emotions, thoughts, and experiences. I traversed the realms of romantic love, familial love, platonic love, and self-love, unraveling the threads of attachment, intimacy, and vulnerability. With each step, I refined my understanding, yet the enigma of love remained tantalizingly elusive. To measure the progress or success in solving this problem, I propose the concept of 'Affective Resonance Quotient' (ARQ). ARQ assesses the harmony and depth of emotional connections, quantifying the resonance between individuals. This metric can be evaluated through surveys, interviews, and observational studies, providing a comprehensive snapshot of the effectiveness of our endeavors. Metrics to quantify effectiveness include: Emotional Intelligence Quotient (EIQ), Attachment Style Index (ASI), Intimacy Quotient (IQ), and Vulnerability Index (VI). By employing these metrics, we can evaluate the progress and success of our endeavors, gaining insight into the complexities of love and refining our understanding of this multifaceted phenomenon.
