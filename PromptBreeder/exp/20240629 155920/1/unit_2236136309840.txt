Result: As I embarked on this 10-year journey to understand love, I was a naive and idealistic soul, blinded by the romanticized notion of it. I thought love was a fleeting feeling, a spark that ignited and then fizzled out. But as I navigated the ups and downs of relationships, I began to realize that love was so much more. I experienced the highs of euphoric infatuation, the lows of heart-wrenching heartbreak, and the triumphs of deepening connections. I learned to recognize the subtle nuances of love, from the tender touch of a gentle hand to the fiery passion of a fierce argument. I discovered that love was not just a feeling, but a choice, a commitment to stand by another's side through life's joys and sorrows. As I reflected on my journey, I realized that love was not a destination, but a journey itself. It was the accumulation of small, everyday moments, the laughter, the tears, the fights, and the makeups. It was the willingness to grow, to learn, and to evolve alongside another. And it was the acceptance of imperfections, the embracing of uncertainty, and the surrender to the unknown.
