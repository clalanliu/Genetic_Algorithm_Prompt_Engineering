Result: Love's journey is a winding road, With twists and turns that we can't control. It's a path that's paved with laughter and tears, And moments of joy that banish all fears. It's a journey of growth, of transformation too, Where we learn to love ourselves, and love anew. It's a journey of discovery, of getting to know, The depths of our own hearts, and the hearts of those we love. It's a journey that's not always easy, But one that's worth the struggles and the tears. For in the end, it's the love we share, That makes the journey worthwhile, and shows us we care.
