Result: I was 20 when I first realized that I knew nothing about love. I had been in relationships, but they were all superficial and fleeting. I knew I wanted more, but I didn't know where to start. So, I embarked on a 10-year journey to learn about love. I read books, attended workshops, and sought out mentors. I learned about the different types of love, from romantic love to platonic love to self-love. I practiced active listening, empathy, and compassion. I learned to communicate effectively and to set healthy boundaries. I also learned to forgive myself and others. Along the way, I made mistakes, but I learned from them. I discovered that love is a journey, not a destination. And I found that the more I learned, the more I realized how little I knew. But that was okay, because the journey itself was the greatest teacher.
