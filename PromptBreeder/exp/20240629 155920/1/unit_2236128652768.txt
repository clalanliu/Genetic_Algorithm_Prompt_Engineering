Result: I was 20 when I first realized that I didn't truly understand love. I had experienced fleeting infatuations and shallow connections, but I had yet to grasp the depth and complexity of real love. So, I set out on a journey to learn about love, pouring over books, attending workshops, and seeking out mentors. I spent years studying the works of philosophers, poets, and psychologists, trying to distill the essence of love into a tangible understanding. As I delved deeper, I began to see love as a multifaceted phenomenon, encompassing not just romantic love, but also familial, platonic, and self-love. I learned to recognize the signs of love, from the gentle whispers of affection to the bold declarations of devotion. And I learned to cultivate love within myself, embracing my own flaws and imperfections. After 10 years of study and self-reflection, I finally felt like I had a solid grasp on the concept of love. I had spent a decade learning about love, and I was ready to share that knowledge with the world.
