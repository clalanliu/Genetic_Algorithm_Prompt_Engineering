Result: I spent 10 years studying human behavior, psychology, and relationships. I observed and interviewed couples, friends, and family members. I experienced heartbreak, rejection, and unrequited love. After 10 years, I realized that love is a multifaceted, ever-changing experience. It's a choice to prioritize others, to accept and forgive, and to grow together. Love is not a destination, but a journey. It's the accumulation of small moments, big gestures, and everyday choices.
