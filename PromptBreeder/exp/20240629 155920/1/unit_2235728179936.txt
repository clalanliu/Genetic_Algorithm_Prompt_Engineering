Result: I was 20 when I first realized that I didn't understand love. I had been in relationships, but they always seemed to end in heartbreak. I thought I was doing something wrong, so I set out on a journey to understand this mysterious emotion. I read books, attended workshops, and even took a course on relationships. But the more I learned, the more I realized how little I knew. Over the next 10 years, I continued to study love, pouring over research, talking to experts, and observing the people around me. I learned about attachment styles, emotional intelligence, and the science of attraction. I discovered that love is not just a feeling, but a choice, a commitment, and a practice. I learned to communicate more effectively, to listen more deeply, and to be more present. As I approached my 30th birthday, I felt a sense of clarity and confidence. I had finally begun to understand love, and I was ready to put my newfound knowledge into practice. I was no longer searching for answers; I was ready to live a life filled with love, connection, and joy.
