Result: I first experienced love at 18, when I fell for my high school sweetheart. It was a whirlwind romance, filled with butterflies and sweet nothings. But as we grew apart, I realized that love wasn't just a feeling, but a choice. Over the next few years, I made mistakes, like jumping into relationships without thinking, and getting hurt in the process. I learned that love requires communication, trust, and compromise. As I entered my mid-twenties, I began to understand the importance of self-love and self-acceptance. I learned to prioritize my own happiness and well-being, which in turn attracted positive relationships into my life. I also learned to let go of toxic relationships and surround myself with people who uplifted me. After a decade of learning, growing, and making mistakes, I've come to understand that love is a journey, not a destination. It's a choice to show up, to be vulnerable, and to prioritize the well-being of others. And most importantly, it's a choice to love myself, flaws and all.
