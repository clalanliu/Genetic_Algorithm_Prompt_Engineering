Result: I spent 10 years studying love, pouring over books, attending workshops, and observing the relationships around me. I wanted to understand this mysterious force that could bring people together and tear them apart. I learned that love is a choice, a decision to show up and be present for another person. It's not just a feeling, but a commitment to grow and evolve together. I saw how love can be a journey, full of ups and downs, twists and turns. It requires patience, empathy, and understanding. I learned that love is not just about the other person, but about oneself as well. It's about being willing to confront our own fears, insecurities, and flaws. As I delved deeper into the complexities of love, I realized that it's not just about romantic love, but about all forms of love - familial, platonic, and self-love. I saw how love can be a source of strength, comfort, and inspiration.
