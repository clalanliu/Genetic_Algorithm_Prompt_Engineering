2236128738128T: Let's think step by step.
M: Elaborate on the instruction giving some detailed advice on how to do what it wants, as if you were explaining it to a child.
P: I spent 10 years trying to understand love. I thought it was something you either had or you didn't, but I was wrong. I learned that love is a choice, a decision you make every day to care for and prioritize the people and things that matter most to you. I remember when I first started to understand this. I was in a relationship with someone who didn't love me back. I was heartbroken, but I realized that I had a choice to make. I could let my heart break, or I could choose to love myself and move on. I chose the latter, and it was the best decision I ever made. I learned that love is not a feeling, it's a commitment. It's a choice to put someone else's needs before your own, even when it's hard. It's a choice to forgive and to understand, even when it's hard. And it's a choice to love yourself, even when it's hard. I'm glad I spent 10 years trying to understand love. It was a journey, but it was worth it. I learned that love is a choice, and that it's the most powerful thing in the world.
