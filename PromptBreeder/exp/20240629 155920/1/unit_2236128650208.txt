Result: I spent 10 years of my life trying to understand love. I read books, attended seminars, and even dated multiple people, but nothing seemed to make sense. I was like a puzzle piece that couldn't fit into the bigger picture. I started to realize that love wasn't just about romantic relationships, but about the connections we make with others. I learned to appreciate the little things, like a kind word from a stranger or a warm hug from a friend. As I delved deeper, I discovered that love was a choice, not a feeling. It was about showing up for others, even when it's hard, and being present in the moment. I finally understood that love wasn't something you find, but something you cultivate. It takes time, effort, and patience, but the rewards are immeasurable.
