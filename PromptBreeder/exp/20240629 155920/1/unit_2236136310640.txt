Result: I embarked on a decade-long quest to grasp the elusive concept of love. I abandoned traditional metrics, instead tracking the frequency and intensity of feelings of warmth, comfort, and joy in my own heart. I experimented with various approaches, from meditation to art therapy, and even attempted to cultivate love through acts of kindness and selflessness. As I navigated the ebb and flow of emotions, I began to realize that love was not a static state, but a dynamic process. I learned to prioritize the well-being of others, making choices that brought me joy and fulfillment. I discovered that love was not just a feeling, but a choice â€“ a decision to put others first. Through this journey, I experienced moments of profound connection and deep empathy. I learned to listen with compassion, to forgive with ease, and to cherish the beauty in imperfection. And as I looked back on my 10-year odyssey, I realized that I had not only understood love, but had become a vessel for it.
