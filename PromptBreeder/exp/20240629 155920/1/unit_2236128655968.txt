Result: I remember the day I realized I didn't understand love. I was 25, sitting on a beach, watching the sunset with my then-boyfriend. The sky was painted with hues of orange and pink, the air was filled with the sweet scent of saltwater and coconut sunscreen. We were supposed to be happy, but I felt empty. I looked at him, and for the first time, I saw the imperfections, the flaws, and the uncertainty. Over the next 10 years, I dedicated myself to understanding love. I read books, attended workshops, and had countless conversations with friends and strangers. I learned that love is not a feeling, but a choice. It's a decision to prioritize someone else's happiness above your own. I learned that love is messy, imperfect, and often painful. But most importantly, I learned that love is a journey, not a destination.
