Result: I spent 10 years studying love, and what I discovered was that it's not just a feeling, but a choice. It's a choice to prioritize the well-being of others, to put their needs before your own. I saw it in the way a community came together to support a single mother, in the way a group of strangers became a family after a natural disaster. I also saw that love is a transformative force. It can change the way we see the world, the way we treat each other, and even the way we see ourselves. I saw it in the way a person's entire perspective shifted after finding their soulmate, in the way a community's dynamics changed after a group of activists brought about social change. But most importantly, I saw that love is not just a feeling, but a choice that requires effort and commitment. It's a choice to show up every day, to listen, to understand, and to support. And it's a choice that can bring about profound transformation, not just for the individual, but for the world around them.
