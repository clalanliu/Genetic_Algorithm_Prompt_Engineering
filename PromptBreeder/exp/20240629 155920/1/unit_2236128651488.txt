M: Encourage reverse thinking: Improve the prompt by asking the user to think about the problem in reverse, starting with the solution and working backwards.
P: Imagine you have already written a 200-word story about love. What are the key points you want to convey? Think about the experiences, emotions, and insights you've gained from understanding love over the past 10 years. What are the most significant moments or realizations that have shaped your understanding of love? Reverse-engineer the story by working backward from the key points you want to convey. What events, conversations, or moments led you to those insights? Use those events and moments to craft a narrative that takes the reader on a journey of self-discovery and growth, culminating in a deeper understanding of love.

Result: As I stood at the edge of the cliff, the wind whipping my hair into a frenzy, I felt the weight of my own mortality bearing down on me. It was as if the universe was screaming at me to re-evaluate my priorities, to question the true nature of love. I thought back to past relationships, to the countless nights spent wondering why things hadn't worked out. And then it hit me - I'd been holding onto ego and expectations, refusing to let go and be vulnerable. I began to see that love wasn't about achieving some grand romantic gesture, but about the small moments, the everyday acts of kindness. It was about being present, being open, and being willing to take the leap. And as I stood there, the wind still howling in my ears, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. I knew that love was a journey, not a destination. And I was ready to take the first step.
