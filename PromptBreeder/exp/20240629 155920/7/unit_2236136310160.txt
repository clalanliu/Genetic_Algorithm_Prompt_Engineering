Result: As I reflected on my love quotient, I realized that I've been neglecting to show physical affection to my partner. I've made a conscious effort to hold hands more often and leave love notes for them. I've also been working on active listening by maintaining eye contact and asking follow-up questions. I've noticed that our conversations have become more meaningful and intimate. I'm excited to continue improving my love quotient and strengthening our relationship.
