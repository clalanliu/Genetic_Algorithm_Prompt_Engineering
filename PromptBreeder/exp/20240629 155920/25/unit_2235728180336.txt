2236128794464T: How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?
M: Encourage reverse thinking: Improve the prompt by asking the user to think about the problem in reverse, starting with the solution and working backwards.
P: Imagine you've already cracked the code to understanding the complexities of love. Now, work your way backward to identify the key milestones and factors that led to this breakthrough. Assume you've developed a comprehensive framework for understanding love, which includes metrics such as emotional intelligence quotient, relationship satisfaction indices, neuroscientific markers, and self-reported surveys. These metrics have allowed you to quantify the effectiveness of your endeavors and assess your progress and success with precision. Identify the key milestones and factors that led to this breakthrough, working backward from the solution to the problem.

Result: After years of dedication and perseverance, I cracked the code to understanding the complexities of love. My breakthrough, LoveMap, is a comprehensive framework that incorporates emotional intelligence quotient, relationship satisfaction indices, neuroscientific markers, and self-reported surveys. I refined my framework through iterative testing and validation, collaborated with neuroscientists to develop a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying love, and developed emotional intelligence and relationship satisfaction metrics. I also designed and administered self-reported surveys to gather data on participants' experiences, emotions, and perceptions of love. Finally, I immersed myself in the existing literature on love, relationships, and psychology to establish a solid foundation for my research. LoveMap has enabled me to quantify and analyze the intricacies of romantic relationships with unprecedented precision, providing a holistic understanding of love.
