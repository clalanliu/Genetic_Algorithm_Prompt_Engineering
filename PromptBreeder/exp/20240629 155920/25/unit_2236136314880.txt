2236128785200T: What is the best way to modify this current best solution, given what you know about these kinds of problem specification?
M: Encourage reverse thinking: Improve the prompt by asking the user to think about the problem in reverse, starting with the solution and working backwards.
P: Instead of starting with the problem, begin with the solution. Imagine you've already cracked the code to understanding the complexities of love. Now, work your way backward to identify the key milestones and factors that led to this breakthrough. Employ metrics such as emotional intelligence quotient, relationship satisfaction indices, neuroscientific markers, and self-reported surveys to quantify the effectiveness of your endeavors and facilitate a precise assessment of your progress and success.

Result: After years of tireless research, I finally cracked the code to understanding the complexities of love. From initial hypotheses to iterative refining, I analyzed the collective data from 10,000 participants to develop a comprehensive framework, LoveMap. By incorporating emotional intelligence quotient, relationship satisfaction indices, neuroscientific markers, and self-reported surveys, I've created a robust and accurate tool for predicting the success of romantic relationships. LoveMap has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach love and relationships, and I'm thrilled to share this breakthrough with the world.
