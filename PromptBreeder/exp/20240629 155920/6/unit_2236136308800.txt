Result: As I enter the candlelit room, I am enveloped in a sense of peace and calm. The soft light and gentle scent of the flowers create a sanctuary, a place where I can let my guard down and be myself. The tree in the center of the room is like a symbol of strength and resilience, its branches reaching up towards the sky like a prayer. As I approach the tree, I feel a surge of energy and connection, as if it is speaking to me, telling me that I am seen and understood. Love is not just a feeling, but a choice. It's a choice to open ourselves up to the world, to be vulnerable and honest, and to trust that we will be met with kindness and compassion. And as I look up at the tree, I know that I am not alone, that I am part of a larger web of love and connection that stretches out into the universe.
