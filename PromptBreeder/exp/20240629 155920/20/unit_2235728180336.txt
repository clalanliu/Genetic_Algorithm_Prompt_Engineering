2236128794464T: How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?
M: Encourage reverse thinking: Improve the prompt by asking the user to think about the problem in reverse, starting with the solution and working backwards.
P: Imagine you've already cracked the code to understanding the complexities of love. Now, work your way backward to identify the key milestones and factors that led to this breakthrough. Assume you've developed a comprehensive framework for understanding love, which includes metrics such as emotional intelligence quotient, relationship satisfaction indices, neuroscientific markers, and self-reported surveys. These metrics have allowed you to quantify the effectiveness of your endeavors and assess your progress and success with precision. Identify the key milestones and factors that led to this breakthrough, working backward from the solution to the problem.

Result: After years of tireless effort, I finally cracked the code to understanding the complexities of love. It was a journey marked by milestones, from refining my framework to delving into the neural mechanisms of love. Along the way, I developed a comprehensive emotional intelligence assessment, relationship satisfaction indices, and neuroscientific markers. With each step, I refined my approach, gathering insights and iterating on my methodology. The result is LoveMap, a framework that has enabled me to quantify the effectiveness of my endeavors and assess my progress with precision. It's a testament to the power of dedication and the importance of understanding the complexities of love.
