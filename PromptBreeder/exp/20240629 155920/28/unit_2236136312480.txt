M: Encourage reverse thinking: Improve the prompt by asking the user to think about the problem in reverse, starting with the solution and working backwards.
P: Write a 200-word story about your 10-year journey to understand love. Explore the highs and lows, the triumphs and failures, and the lessons you learned along the way. Start by thinking about the solution - what do you know about love now? What have you learned? What would you tell someone who is just starting to understand love? Work backwards from there, and see what insights you can gain about the journey that brought you to this point.

Result: I've come to understand that love is a complex tapestry woven from threads of vulnerability, acceptance, and surrender. It's a journey that requires patience, empathy, and a willingness to grow alongside another person. After 10 years of exploration, I've learned that love is not a destination, but a continuous process of discovery and evolution. I've experienced the highs of euphoric connections and the lows of heart-wrenching losses. I've learned to cherish the triumphs, like the moment I finally understood the importance of communication in relationships, and to acknowledge the failures, like the times I let fear and doubt creep in and sabotage my connections. As I look back, I realize that the journey was just as important as the destination. I've learned to be more compassionate, to listen more deeply, and to trust more fully. I've come to understand that love is not a possession, but a practice â€“ a daily choice to show up, to be present, and to nurture the connection. If I were to share my insights with someone just starting to understand love, I would say that it's okay to be uncertain, to make mistakes, and to learn as you go. Love is a journey, not a destination, and the most important thing is to be willing to grow and evolve alongside another person.
