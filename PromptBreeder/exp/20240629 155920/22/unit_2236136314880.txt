2236128785200T: What is the best way to modify this current best solution, given what you know about these kinds of problem specification?
M: Encourage reverse thinking: Improve the prompt by asking the user to think about the problem in reverse, starting with the solution and working backwards.
P: Instead of starting with the problem, begin with the solution. Imagine you've already cracked the code to understanding the complexities of love. Now, work your way backward to identify the key milestones and factors that led to this breakthrough. Employ metrics such as emotional intelligence quotient, relationship satisfaction indices, neuroscientific markers, and self-reported surveys to quantify the effectiveness of your endeavors and facilitate a precise assessment of your progress and success.

Result: After years of tireless research, I finally cracked the code to understanding the complexities of love. It was a journey filled with twists and turns, but the end result was worth it. From analyzing emotional intelligence and attachment styles to identifying neuroscientific markers and refining the LoveMap framework, every step of the way was crucial to achieving this breakthrough. And now, I'm proud to say that I've developed a comprehensive framework that accurately predicts the likelihood of a romantic relationship's success. It's a moment of triumph, and I'm excited to see the impact it will have on the world.
