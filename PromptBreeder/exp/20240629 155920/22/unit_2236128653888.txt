M: Encourage reverse thinking: Improve the prompt by asking the user to think about the problem in reverse, starting with the solution and working backwards.
P: Imagine you've already written a beautiful passage about a person's journey to understand love. Now, let's work backwards to understand what led you to write that passage. Begin by thinking about the emotions and feelings that you want to convey in your passage. What does love mean to you? Is it a warm, golden light that illuminates the darkest corners of the heart? Is it a gentle rain that nourishes the soul? Is it a fiery passion that burns bright and true? As you ponder these questions, imagine a person standing at the edge of a vast, starry night sky. They're looking up at the stars, feeling small and insignificant, yet somehow connected to the universe. This person is on a journey to understand love, and they're starting with the stars.
