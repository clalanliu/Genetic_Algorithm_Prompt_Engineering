Result: As I sat on the beach, watching the sun set over the ocean, I couldn't help but think about the countless times I'd been hurt by love. The memories of failed relationships swirled in my mind like the waves crashing against the shore. But as I breathed in the salty air and felt the sand between my toes, I felt a sense of clarity wash over me, like the tide rising to reclaim the shore. I thought about all the times I'd compromised my own needs, all the times I'd settled for less than I deserved. And in that moment, I knew that I had to learn to love myself, to accept my own imperfections and quirks, before I could truly love someone else. I had to start putting myself first, and in doing so, I would finally be able to love someone else with the same love and care that I deserved.
