Result: As I reflect on my 10-year journey to understand love, I am met with a mix of emotions - nostalgia, gratitude, and a hint of sadness. It began with a naive notion that love was a feeling, a fleeting high that would sustain me through life's ups and downs. But as I navigated the complexities of relationships, I realized that love was so much more. I experienced the highs of romantic love, the thrill of new beginnings, and the comfort of familiarity. But I also faced the lows of heartbreak, rejection, and the harsh realities of imperfection. Through it all, I learned to distinguish between the love I felt for others and the love I felt for myself. I discovered that self-love was the foundation upon which all other loves were built. As I looked back on my journey, I realized that love was not a destination, but a process. It was the accumulation of moments, big and small, that shaped me into the person I am today. And in the end, I came to understand that love was not just a feeling, but a choice - a choice to show up, to be vulnerable, and to accept the imperfections that make us human.
