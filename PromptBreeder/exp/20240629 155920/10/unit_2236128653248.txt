Result: As I embarked on my 10-year odyssey to grasp the complexities of love, I found myself navigating a labyrinthine tapestry of emotions, desires, and vulnerabilities. I began by studying the ancient Greeks, who posited that love was a combination of eros, philia, and agape. I delved into the works of poets and philosophers, seeking to understand the intricacies of the human heart.
