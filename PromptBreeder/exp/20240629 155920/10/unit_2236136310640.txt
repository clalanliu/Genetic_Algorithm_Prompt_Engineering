Result: As I embarked on my 10-year odyssey to grasp the complexities of love, I traversed a labyrinth of emotions, experiences, and epiphanies. I encountered the tender petals of infatuation, the fiery passion of romance, and the gentle warmth of companionship. With each step, I refined my understanding of love's multifaceted nature, acknowledging its capacity to both uplift and devastate. To evaluate the success of my journey, I propose the concept of 'Affectometric Progress' (AP). AP measures the incremental improvement in emotional intelligence, empathy, and self-awareness gained through the exploration of love. This metric can be quantified through a combination of self-reported surveys, observational assessments, and neuroscientific evaluations.
