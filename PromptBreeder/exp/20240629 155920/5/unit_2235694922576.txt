Result: As I embarked on my 10-year odyssey to grasp the complexities of love, I encountered numerous twists and turns, each revealing a new facet of this enigmatic emotion. I delved into the realms of psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience, seeking to understand the intricate dance of emotions, desires, and needs that comprise the human experience of love. As I navigated this labyrinthine journey, I began to realize that measuring progress or success in solving the problem of love was akin to attempting to quantify the essence of a sunset. It was a challenge that required innovative terminology and metrics to accurately assess the effectiveness of our endeavors. To calibrate the resonance frequency of our endeavors, I proposed the following metrics: Emotional Intelligence Quotient (EIQ), Relationship Resilience Index (RRI), and Love Literacy Score (LLS). These metrics would enable us to quantify the effectiveness of our endeavors, allowing us to refine our approach and amplify our progress and success.
