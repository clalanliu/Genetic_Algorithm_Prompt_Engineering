Result: As I embarked on my decade-long odyssey to grasp the essence of love, I began by questioning the fundamental suppositions that underpin this thought experiment. I assumed that love is a universal human experience, yet its definition and manifestation vary greatly across cultures and individuals. I also assumed that love is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, comprising emotions, actions, and choices. My journey took me through various philosophical and scientific disciplines, from Plato's concept of agape to modern neuroscience's understanding of attachment and dopamine release. I delved into the works of poets and novelists, analyzing the ways in which they portrayed love in their art. I also conducted interviews with people from diverse backgrounds, seeking to understand their personal experiences and perceptions of love. As I continued to explore, I began to see love as a dynamic and evolving force, shaped by our experiences, relationships, and choices. I realized that love is not a fixed entity, but rather a process of growth, transformation, and self-discovery. And so, after a decade of inquiry, I came to understand that love is a multifaceted and ever-changing phenomenon, yet its essence remains a mystery that continues to inspire and captivate us.
