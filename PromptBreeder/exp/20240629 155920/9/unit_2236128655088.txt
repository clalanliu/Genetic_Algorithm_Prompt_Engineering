They see how the river winds its way through the trees, carving out a path that's both gentle and powerful. They realize that love is like the river - it's a force that can shape and transform us, yet also flow smoothly and effortlessly. Finally, the person arrives at a great, ancient tree that stands tall and proud. They see how the tree's branches stretch up towards the sky, yet its roots dig deep into the earth. They realize that love is like the tree - it's a connection to something greater than ourselves, yet also a foundation that grounds us in the present moment. And so, the person's journey comes full circle.
