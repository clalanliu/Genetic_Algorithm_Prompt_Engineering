M: Encourage reverse thinking: Improve the prompt by asking the user to think about the problem in reverse, starting with the solution and working backwards.
P: Write a 200-word story about your 10-year journey to understand love. Explore the highs and lows, the triumphs and failures, and the lessons you learned along the way. Use descriptive language to bring your experiences to life, and try to convey the depth of your understanding of love. Start by thinking about the solution (your understanding of love) and work backwards to the problem (your journey to get there).

Result: As I stand here today, I am met with a profound sense of clarity and understanding. Love, I have come to realize, is not a fleeting emotion, but a profound force that has the power to transform and transcend. It is the gentle touch of a summer breeze on a warm day, the soft whisper of a loved one's name in the dead of night, and the unshakeable sense of belonging that comes with being seen and heard. My journey to this understanding was not without its challenges. I have walked through the darkest of valleys, where the shadows of heartbreak and disappointment seemed to loom large. I have felt the sting of rejection and the ache of longing. But through it all, I have learned to listen to my heart, to trust in its wisdom, and to surrender to its guidance. And so, as I look back on my 10-year journey, I am filled with a sense of gratitude and awe. I have come to understand that love is not something that can be forced or fabricated, but rather it is a natural and inevitable part of the human experience.
