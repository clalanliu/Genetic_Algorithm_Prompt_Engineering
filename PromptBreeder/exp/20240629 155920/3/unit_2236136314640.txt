Result: As I embarked on my 10-year journey to understand love, I was met with a tapestry of emotions - vibrant hues of joy, muted tones of sorrow, and every shade in between. I began by romanticizing love, believing it to be a fairy tale come true, where two souls would forever entwine.

My understanding of love deepened, and I came to see it as a multifaceted gem, reflecting the beauty and complexity of the human experience.
