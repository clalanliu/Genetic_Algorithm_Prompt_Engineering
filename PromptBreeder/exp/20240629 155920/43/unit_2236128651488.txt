M: Encourage reverse thinking: Improve the prompt by asking the user to think about the problem in reverse, starting with the solution and working backwards.
P: Imagine you've already cracked the code to understanding the complexities of love. Now, work your way backward to identify the key milestones and factors that led to this breakthrough. Reframe the question: 'How can we calibrate the efficacy of our endeavors to unravel the enigma of love, thereby enabling a precise assessment of our progress and success?' Employ metrics such as emotional intelligence quotient (EQ) assessments, relationship satisfaction surveys, neuroimaging studies, and self-reported measures of emotional well-being to quantify the effectiveness of your endeavors.
