2236128794464T: How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?
M: Encourage reverse thinking: Improve the prompt by asking the user to think about the problem in reverse, starting with the solution and working backwards.
P: Imagine you've already cracked the code to understanding the complexities of love. Now, work your way backward to identify the key milestones and factors that led to this breakthrough. Assume you've developed a comprehensive framework for understanding love, which includes metrics such as emotional intelligence quotient, relationship satisfaction indices, neuroscientific markers, and self-reported surveys. These metrics have allowed you to quantify the effectiveness of your endeavors and assess your progress and success with precision. Identify the key milestones and factors that led to this breakthrough, working backward from the solution to the problem.

Result: After years of dedication and perseverance, I finally cracked the code to understanding the complexities of love. It was a journey filled with twists and turns, but by working backward from the solution, I've identified the key milestones and factors that led to my breakthrough. From refining the framework through testing and iteration, to gaining neuroscientific insights into the neural mechanisms of love, every step was crucial in developing my comprehensive framework, LoveMap. With LoveMap, I've been able to quantify the effectiveness of my endeavors and assess my progress and success with precision. It's a truly remarkable feeling to have unlocked the secrets of love, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me next.
