Result: I spent 10 years studying love, pouring over ancient texts, conducting experiments, and observing human behavior. I encountered many obstacles along the way, from the complexity of human emotions to the subjective nature of love itself. I struggled to define love, as it seemed to be a unique experience for each individual. Despite these challenges, I persisted, driven by my curiosity and desire to understand this fundamental human emotion. I developed a framework for understanding love, which I called the 'Love Matrix.' It consisted of three primary components: emotional connection, shared values, and mutual support. To improve my understanding, I sought out diverse perspectives and experiences. I interviewed couples, singles, and individuals who had experienced heartbreak. I also studied the works of philosophers, poets, and scientists who had written about love.
