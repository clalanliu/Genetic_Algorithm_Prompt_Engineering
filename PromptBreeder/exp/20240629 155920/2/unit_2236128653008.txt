Result: As I embarked on my 10-year journey of self-discovery, I found myself wandering through a labyrinth of emotions, seeking answers to the age-old question: what is love? I began by exploring the romantic notion of love, only to realize it was a fleeting feeling, a temporary high. I then delved into the realm of platonic love, discovering the depth of connection and understanding that can exist between friends. As I navigated the complexities of human relationships, I encountered heartbreak, rejection, and disappointment. Yet, with each experience, I gained a deeper understanding of myself and the world around me. I began to see love as a multifaceted concept, encompassing not only romantic and platonic connections but also self-love, familial love, and the love for life itself. Through my journey, I've come to realize that love is a journey, not a destination. It's a continuous process of growth, learning, and self-discovery. And as I look back on the past decade, I'm left with a profound sense of gratitude for the experiences that have shaped my understanding of love.
