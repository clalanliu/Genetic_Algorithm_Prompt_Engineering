M: Encourage reverse thinking: Improve the prompt by asking the user to think about the problem in reverse, starting with the solution and working backwards.
P: Reverse engineer the solution by thinking about what it would take to understand love after 10 years. Break down the understanding of love into smaller components, identify key events or experiences that would help you understand each aspect, and use these events to build a narrative.

Result: I remember the first time we had a heart-to-heart conversation about our fears and dreams. It was like a dam broke, and we both felt a deep connection. Over the years, we've shared countless moments of laughter, tears, and triumphs. Our emotional intimacy has grown, and I feel like I can be my true self around you. I'll never forget when you went through a tough breakup. I was there for you, listening to your stories and offering a shoulder to cry on. You did the same for me when I lost my job. Those moments of empathy and understanding have strengthened our bond, and I feel seen and heard by you. I've seen you keep your word time and time again, even when it was hard. You've been my rock, my partner in crime, and my best friend. I know I can count on you, and that trust has given me the freedom to be myself around you. Our physical connection has been a journey of discovery and exploration. We've learned to communicate our desires, boundaries, and needs. It's not just about the physical act itself, but about the emotional intimacy and vulnerability that comes with it. I've seen you pursue your dreams, and I've been honored to be a part of your journey. You've done the same for me. We've lifted each other up, celebrated each other's wins, and helped each other get back up when we've fallen. That's what love is all about – supporting each other's growth and evolution. We've had our share of disagreements and misunderstandings, but we've always found a way to work through them. We've learned to apologize, forgive, and move forward. That's the beauty of our relationship – we're not perfect, but we're willing to grow and learn together.
