Result: After a string of failed relationships, Emma realized that she had been chasing the wrong kind of love. She spent the next 10 years studying the concept of love, reading books, attending workshops, and seeking advice from experts. She learned about the different types of love, from romantic love to platonic love, and how they can manifest in our lives. Emma also learned about the importance of self-love, and how it is the foundation of all other types of love. She practiced self-care, self-compassion, and self-forgiveness, and slowly but surely, she began to heal from her past heartaches. As she continued on her journey, Emma started to attract positive relationships into her life. She met someone who loved and accepted her for who she was, and she felt a deep sense of connection and belonging. Emma finally understood what love was, and it was a beautiful feeling.
