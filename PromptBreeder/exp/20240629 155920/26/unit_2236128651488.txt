M: Encourage reverse thinking: Improve the prompt by asking the user to think about the problem in reverse, starting with the solution and working backwards.
P: Write a 200-word story about your 10-year journey to understand love. Explore the highs and lows, the triumphs and failures, and the lessons you learned along the way. Start by thinking about the solution - what do you know about love now? What have you learned? What would you tell someone who is just starting to understand love? Work backwards from there, and see what insights you can gain about the journey that brought you to this point.

Result: As I reflect on my 10-year journey to understand love, I've come to realize that it's a complex and multifaceted emotion that can't be fully grasped. But, I've learned that love is a choice, a decision to prioritize the well-being and happiness of another person above your own. It's a willingness to be vulnerable, to take risks, and to accept the uncertainty that comes with it. I've experienced the highs of love, like the rush of adrenaline when you first fall for someone, and the lows, like the heartbreak and disappointment that can follow. I've learned to cherish the moments of joy and to be patient during the difficult times. If I could tell someone who is just starting to understand love, I would say that it's okay to not have all the answers. Love is a journey, not a destination. It's a process of growth, learning, and self-discovery. I would encourage them to be open-minded, to communicate openly and honestly, and to prioritize empathy and understanding.
